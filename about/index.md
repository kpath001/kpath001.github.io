*Hi!* My name is Kevin Path, currently a junior at Pennsylvania State University, pursuing a degree in computer engineering. For the summer of 2015, I will be a research intern at Booz  Allen  Hamilton. I love reading about what is happening in the field of computer science and engineering. I decided I should make thing blog site because I should share my thoughts and inputs on various articles and interesting finds I come across. Shoot me an email or download my resume if you like what you see.
